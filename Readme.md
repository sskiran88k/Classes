Object Real time examples are Person and Car etc

Object Contain Properties and Functionalites 

Car Properties
1) Color
2) Price
3) Model etc

Car Funtions
1) Drive
2) Speed
3) Slow

Propeties are called Atributes/Instance Varibales 
Fucntions are Called Methods

Class is a Blueprint of Object
Class is Code Templeate for object Creation
Object is instance of class


In Python and many other object-oriented programming languages, the concepts of a "class" and an "object" are closely related but distinctly different.

Class: This is a blueprint or prototype that defines a set of attributes and methods that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods are functions that act on this data. A class is a logical entity and it does not occupy any memory space until an instance of the class, i.e., an object, is created.

Object: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, only the specification for the object is defined; no memory or storage is allocated. Objects are instances of the class that are created in memory at runtime, each with their own set of attributes (i.e., data) and behaviors (i.e., methods). The object is a physical entity that occupies memory.

Here's a simple example:

python
Copy code
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")
In this example, Dog is a class that has attributes name and breed, and a method bark.

python
Copy code
my_dog = Dog("Fido", "Labrador")
my_dog is an object, an instance of the Dog class, with the name "Fido" and breed "Labrador". You can call methods on it like so: my_dog.bark(), which will print "Woof!" to the console.

The key difference is the class is the definition, and the object is an instance of that class.

Sure, I'll provide a detailed example using Python code.

Let's create a class named Car. This class will have attributes such as make, model, and color, and methods like start_engine() and stop_engine().

Here's how we define the class:

python
Copy code
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, color):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.engine_status = False

    def start_engine(self):
        if self.engine_status:
            print(f"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is already running.")
        else:
            self.engine_status = True
            print(f"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is now running.")
    
    def stop_engine(self):
        if not self.engine_status:
            print(f"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is already stopped.")
        else:
            self.engine_status = False
            print(f"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine has stopped.")
In this code:

Car is the class that we defined.
__init__() is a special method called a constructor that we use to initialize (i.e., specify) an object's initial attributes by giving them their default value (or state). This method must have at least one argument as well as the self variable, which refers to the object itself.
start_engine() and stop_engine() are methods that we've defined to perform specific actions on the object.
Now, let's create an object of this class:

python
Copy code
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", "Red")
In this line, my_car is an object (also known as an instance) of the Car class. It has the attributes make ("Toyota"), model ("Corolla"), and color ("Red"). The my_car object can also perform the actions defined by the start_engine() and stop_engine() methods.

Here's how we use these methods:

python
Copy code
my_car.start_engine()
my_car.stop_engine()
These lines will respectively start and stop the engine of my_car. They'll also print out a message telling us whether the engine is running or stopped. We could create many different Car objects, each with their own set of attributes and each capable of performing the actions defined by the class's methods.

Remember, the class is the blueprint for objects, and objects are instances of a class. Each object is an individual instance with its own separate attributes, but they all follow the structure and behavior defined by their class.
